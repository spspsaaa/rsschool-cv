### Briefly About Myself:
At the moment I am working in the field of education - I am creating an online course to prepare for Russian graduate exams. I decided to try to study the frontend developer course and move in two areas. I can describe myself as phlegmatic. I am calm about everything, because of this I make decisions quickly. My strengths are thoughtfulness, patience and striving for improvement (and I'm not just talking about myself).
